# Fetch Metadata (FM)

Fetch Metadata headers allow your service to block requests coming from unexpected contexts. FM isolation policies can protect your service from XSRF, [Spectre](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/02/meltdown-spectre), and many [XS-Leaks](https://xsleaks.dev). See [this web.dev article](https://web.dev/fetch-metadata/) for more background information and an introduction to defending your site with Fetch Metadata.
